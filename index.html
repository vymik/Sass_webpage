            <div class="description">
                <p>Bureau of Works is an independent producing company founded by Erin Milne. We are focused on creating strategic opportunities for artists; supporting artists in the creation of new work and exploratory form; and developing contexts that foster risk-taking and ambition. We’re interested in  projects that encompass radical empathy, collaborative teams, good humour and a sense of adventure.</p>
                <p>We enjoy working closely with artists to realise the environment, resources and partners they need to achieve their best work. We also work with organisations to do the same thing, in different contexts. Our services include: producing, market development, event curation, strategic planning, facilitation, project management, research, grant writing, and tenders.</p>
